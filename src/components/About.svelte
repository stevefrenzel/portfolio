  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
    Iâ€™ve worked for a number of exciting startups and established companies. My
    main goal is to
    <mark>translate your vision</mark>
    to your customers or visitors. In order to achieve this, I constantly
    educate myself to be able to decide
    <mark>which technology will best fit</mark>
    your project.
  </p>
  <p>
    First of all I would like to
    <mark>get to know you</mark>
    in order to give your idea a form. Based on this, I will develop an
    <mark>interactive design of the website (or app)</mark>
    together with you, which will serve as the foundation for the final product.
  </p>
  <p>
    The result will be an
    <mark>intuitive</mark>
    ,
    <mark>performant</mark>
    and easily
    <mark>accessible</mark>
    product, taking current development best practices into account.
