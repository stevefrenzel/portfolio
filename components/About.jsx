      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I am not a web developer. At least I was not always. I also have over{' '}
        <mark>10 years experience</mark> in the music business as a sound
        engineer, producer and stagehand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to this time I learned a lot about people and how to work with
        them. I have also learned to <mark>plan large and small projects</mark>{' '}
        of all kinds, to execute them carefully and implement them successfully.
      </p>
      <p>
        <mark>Translating your vision</mark> to your customers (or visitors) is
        my main goal. In order to achieve this, I constantly educate myself to
        be able to decide which technology will best fit your project.The result
        will be an{' '}
        <mark>intuitive, performant and easily accessible product</mark>, taking
        current development best practices into account.
