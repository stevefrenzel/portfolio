      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I am not a web developer. At least I was not always. I also have over 10
        years experience in the music business as a sound engineer, producer and
        stagehand. Thanks to this time I learned a lot about people and how to
        work with them. I have also learned to plan large and small projects of
        all kinds, to execute them carefully and implement them successfully.

        Translating your vision to your customers (or visitors) is my main goal.
        In order to achieve this, I constantly educate myself to be able to
        decide which technology will best fit your project.The result will be an
        intuitive, performant and easily accessible product, taking current
        development best practices into account.
