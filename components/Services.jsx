      <h2>Services</h2>
      <h3>1. First meeting and planning</h3>
      <p>
        Meeting in person or via video call to get to know each other and
        discuss the scope and cost of the project. (Free of charge!)
      </p>
      <h3>2. Creating a draft</h3>
      <p>
        Developing an interactive design of the project. Either as design in
        Sketch or live (and privat) on Netlify.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Building the project</h3>
      <p>
        Developing your website (or app) with Accessibility, Best Practices,
        Performance and SEO in mind. To measure these values, I use Google
        Lighthouse, among others.
      </p>
      <h3>4. Maintenance</h3>
      <p>
        If desired, I can maintain the project for a monthly fee. Prices depend
        on the size of it and duration of support.
